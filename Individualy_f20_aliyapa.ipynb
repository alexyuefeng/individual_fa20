    "    With that being said, however, there was a reported increase in violent crime in city neighborhoods in recent years, according to an article by Th San Diego Tribune(3). Additionally, another recent article by the same source also talked about park curfews that were being put in place in response to crime concerns, as the article stated, \"Police say curfews can be effective at reducing crime because they limit opportunities for illegal activity and provide officers with another enforcement tool\"(1).\n",

    "Given that I had posed three seperate questions with the interest of gaining perspective on information from a number of angels, I had three separate hypothesis corresponding to each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I hypothesize that there will be a trend of more calls being made during earlier in the day, when it may seem more porbable for someone to try commiting a crime, specially in isolated areas with less public; however this would also mean that any passerby may be able to witness, given that there will be daylight, hence make a call for services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, I hypothesize that there will be a trend of the calls being made more often during the warmer months as that is when people are often more agitated, leading to more criminal activities to occur; moreover,it will be more common for people to be outdoors do witness any disorderly conduct or violent crime, along with any of the calls made for the indoors witness criminal activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, I hypothesize that more calls may be made during the weekends than the weekdays, as people might be too busy with work or school on weekdays, making it easier for crimes to be commited, such as break ins, and public noticing it after the crime has been commited. Also more public is outdoors and moving about during the weekends, going to places, increasing the chances for the calls to be made. Lastly, a lot more parties and such events take place during the weekend too, increasing the chances of DUIs or noise disturbances being reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourthly, and lastly, I hypothesize that with an increase in the budget set aside for Crime Scene Services the number of calls with reduce for that year as more patrol officers will be out and about, making it less common for public to report the crime, but rather the cops catching up to the criminals and either preventing the misdemeanor or felony to take place in the first place, or taking appropriate actions,in a timely manner."

    "Through the analyses that I performed, I was able to conclude that more calls were made during the early mornings, between 9am and 11 am, most commonly at 10 am, with 2017 being an exception to the trend. I believe this may prove my hypothesis correct that although there are higher chances someone might want to commit a crime in early mornings when public is too busy with their daily tasks, it is equally probable for people to witness a crime or felony being commited in broad daylight, while commuting to places. Secondly, my second hypothesis were proven incorrect as the frequency of calls made per month, in a given year, differed for each year, which would also make sense as, we have not ended this year yet, making it harder to make a conclusive observation. Additionally, my third hypothesis of more calls being made during the weekend rather than weekdays was also proven wrong, as the calls being made were pretty evenly spread through out the week, which again would be a plausable conclusion to reach as the severity of the crimes vary and so there is not a way where crimes will only be commited over one specific time of the week. Lastly, a trend was not noticed with the higher budget being set aside leading to less calls being made, in fact although the highest budget was set aside for the fiscal year of 2019, and 2019 was when the highest number of calls were made. This can be due to a few reasons, but most probably, a higher budget might mean a higher response rate and a higher number of service available to respond to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think it was rather uncomforting to know that a trend could not be seen for the time of the year or time  of the week when calls for services are more often made, that may have helped us determine how to prevent encountering dangerous situations now that we will be relying on parks and recreation so heavily. However, it was reassuring to see that the time of the day such as late afternoons and evenings, were not ones that had the highest calls made, meaning less criminal activities take place during that time, allowing the public to be safe when out during those times. It can in fact be assumed just from general knowledge and as is usually those times are when public makes use of parks and recreation to begin with.\n",

    "In the future, I would like to zoom in more into if there are specific areas within San Diego cities that should be avoided later in the evening."

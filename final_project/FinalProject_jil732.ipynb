    "People are very used to reviewing restruants and other places on Yelp, but what about parks and recreation centers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp is known for the platform to review businesses (1). Usually when people don't know if a local business is good, such as a resturant, they will refer to the reviews on Yelp. On the other hand, parks are usually operated by the city, and not usually labelled as local business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies\" (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A recreation center is a place for recreational activities usually administered by a municipal government agency.\" (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A census tract, census area, census district or meshblock[1] is a geographic region defined for the purpose of taking a census.[2] Sometimes these coincide with the limits of cities, towns or other administrative areas[2] and several tracts commonly exist within a county. Census tracts represent the smallest territorial entity for which population data are available in many countries.[3] In the United States, census tracts are subdivided into block groups and census blocks\" (4). In this project, we use the census tract as the geography unit for our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of prior work on what motivates people to leave more reviews on Yelp for San Diego parks and recreation centers is very limited. As a result, I didn't have the luck to find any related work before the deadline of this project. I defintiely hope to invest more time on this part and unfortunately I don't think I can include any here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the gerneral number of reviews on Yelp, I found some information online (5). First, businesses on Yelp should encourage the customers to post reviews on Yelp. If there is any park that encourages the customers to do so, it's reasonable to expect them to have more reviews. But I don't have the data on this so it's not included in this project. Second, businesses should try to offer exclusive deals for customers using Yelp. I don't think this makes sense for most parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A most similar work to this project is (6). It is related since it's also spatial analysis and focused on clusters of business. For this project, however, we don't necessarily analysze the clustering of parks.\n",

It might help people to better understand the parks of San Diego, understand what parks or recreation centers are most popular on Yelp, understand that the popular parks do not distribute uniformally across the whole San Diego county (i.e. a few census tracts have the top popular parks). This may help us to not only think about the access to parks of San Diego residents only but also consider the reviews for the parks."

    "The ideal dataset would contain park demographics, funding, size, and attendance information. Having at least 1000 observations will ensure results are robust as the central limit theroem engages and a normal distribution between funding (after being logarithmically transformed) and accessibility should exist. Most of the data should exist on the parks database as funding, size, and basic demographical information are within city authority. Attendance may be trickier if no one is manually counting the amount of people coming each day. "

    "City data should be public so there wouldn't be any ethical concerns with using it. An issue will arise if the model follows the New York reference above and includes ethnic background information, however this is only possible with the assumption that there is data on park attendance and density mapping available. The easiest means to addressing these issues are to avoid racial biases that may exist since some parks are located in racially dominated zones."

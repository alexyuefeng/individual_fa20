    "One concern everyone has is access to funding. Parks receive various levels of funding as explained by the University of Delaware because they are 'costly and a long-term endeavor' which propels local governments to rely on bonds, local, state, federal, or other funding. While more funding should naturally lead to higher park attendence, it is currently unknown on how much funding is optimal. Therefore, my approach to this project is to adopt the methodology from the 'complexities of measuring access to parks.' However, instead of using race and ethnic backgrounds in an ordinary least squares regression model, I plan on using income data. Considering there are several income sources, then I can identify if a specific type of funding seems to be most useful. The beauty of regression is that I can incorporate additonal variables and easily pivot the project if income data is insufficient to explaining park accessibility - measured by Acre density or Physical Activity Site Density. Now the authors of the New York study found a 'weak relationship between [socioeconomic status] and park accessiblity.' This may be in part to funding issues, which this project seeks to identify whether this is accurate. \n",

    "The ideal dataset would contain park demographics, funding, size, and attendance information. Having at least 1000 observations will ensure results are robust as the central limit theroem engages and a normal distribution between funding (after being logarithmically transformed) and accessibility should exist. Most of the data should exist on the parks database as funding, size, and basic demographical information are within city authority. Attendance may be trickier if no one is manually counting the amount of people coming each day. "

An issue will arise if the model follows the New York reference above and includes ethnic background information, however this is only possible with the assumption that there is data on park attendance and density mapping available. The easiest means to addressing these issues are to avoid racial biases that may exist since some parks are located in racially dominated zones."

Using a dataset from Yelp, I will compare scores using Linear and Multivariate Regression models (Ordinary Least Squares) between general parks, dog parks, and parks overall where dogs are allowed. If dog parks do score a higher rating on average, San Diego City could aim to improve dog parks to increase population attitude and involvement in outdoor activities."

From the analysis, it would not be recommended to use the analysis as evidence to improve dog parks.\n",
